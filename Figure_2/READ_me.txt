To reproduce this Figure, first create a normalised object for spliced and unspliced counts separately (run spliced.R and unspliced.R).
Then run prepare_mofa_object.ipynb to combine them.
Then fit_mofa_model.py.
Then mofa_downstream_an_and_plot_fig_2b1.ipynb and correct_mofa_pca.R to get statistics and factors.
Finally plot the factors with plot_figure2a_b2_3_supp1.ipynb.
